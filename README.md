# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains coursework, assignments, and lab exercises for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Habib University (Spring 2022). The content is organized by homework assignments, labs, and exams, with a focus on practical implementation of core data structures and algorithms in Python.

## Repository Structure

- **HW 1, HW 2, HW 3/**: Homework assignments, including problem statements, solution skeletons, and Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Lab 01 - Lab 13/**: Weekly lab exercises covering a range of topics such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, graph traversal, BST).
- **Mid Term/**: Midterm exam solutions.
- **README.md**: This file.
- **.gitignore**: Standard Python, Jupyter, and IDE ignores.

## Notable Files

- Python scripts (`.py`) for each lab and homework problem.
- Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for interactive solutions and explanations.
- LaTeX files for homework write-ups.
- Excel files for data analysis tasks.

## Usage

1. Browse each folder for the relevant week or assignment.
2. Open `.py` files for code solutions or `.ipynb` notebooks for interactive work.
3. Some folders contain a `README.md` or a Google Colab link for running notebooks online.

## Topics Covered

- List, Stack, Queue, and Priority Queue implementations
- Graph ADT and traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Dijkstra's algorithm and shortest path problems
- Binary Search Trees and related algorithms
- Real-world applications: social networks, contact tracing, etc.
- Balanced parentheses and bracket sequence problems

## How to Run

- Most code is written in Python 3.
- Jupyter Notebooks can be run locally or via Google Colab (see links in lab/homework folders).
- For LaTeX files, use a LaTeX editor to compile PDFs.

## Credits

Coursework and assignments are based on CS 102: Data Structures and Algorithms at Habib University.
